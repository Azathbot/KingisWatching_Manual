King is Watching Manual for Archipelago.

The King is Watching is a roguelite kingdom builder and strategy game developed by Hypnohead and published by tinyBuild, blending elements of auto-battler and tower defense gameplay.
Rules:
You can use every Building you start with. Wheat, Wood and Water are always free to build.

What is Randomized
the Kings, Advisors, Advisor Slots, Buildings, Gaze Upgrades, Troop Limits and Weeks you are allowed to play (to slow you down a bit).

What are Checks? 
every enemy Wave is 3 Checks, Traders Gift 3 Checks, Bosses are 5 Checks as well as some Quests like buying troop limit increases and researching basic constructions and spells.

Problem?:
The Manual is made for an advanced gamestate. it could think you could beat the game with Buildings you havenÂ´t actually unlocked. practically you could always play until you can unlock it. 

If you have suggestions please let me know in the Discord.

To Do:
- optimising progression and how soon you get Levy Barracks and basic Ressources.
- find a modder to get this game out of Manual and/or get rid of savestateprogression problems
